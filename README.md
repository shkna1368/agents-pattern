# 🤖 Intelligent Agent System using Google Gemini & Spring AI

## Overview

This project is a hands-on implementation of **smart autonomous agents** using cutting-edge AI patterns and technologies. The core idea is to build a system where multiple intelligent agents can **think, plan, and collaborate**—powered by the strength of **Google Gemini** and the flexibility of **Spring AI**.

## 🧠 Key Design Patterns Implemented

### 🔁 Reflection Pattern  
Agents are capable of **evaluating their own actions**, learning from mistakes, and refining their behavior over time.

### 📋 Plan and Execute Pattern  
Each agent can **generate a plan based on goals**, then **execute it step by step**, adapting dynamically to changes in the environment.

### 🤝 Multi-Agent Architecture  
Multiple agents work **collaboratively** or **independently**, sharing context, goals, and decisions to solve complex tasks.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- 🌐 **Google Gemini** — For powerful LLM-based reasoning and knowledge grounding.
- ☕ **Spring AI** — For seamless AI integration into a modern Spring-based Java application.
- 🧠 **Custom agent orchestration** — For coordinating multi-agent workflows.



Built with ❤️ using AI and Java.
